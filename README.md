# D195-Capstone
 Southwest Airlines Flight Delays from 2010-2020
 
 * D195-Report-Output.pdf - The output of my scripts with some documentation to help understand the data.
 * explore_data.py - output is cursory look at the data set. What are the features? How many rows in the dataset? Do we have valid values in the data?
 * evaluate_dataset.py - the main analysis file that evaluates the data applies the decision tree classifier and outputs the F1 score, precision and recall. 
 * pca_fit.py - Applies the PCA_Fit to the dataset and the output is the accuracy scores from the fit.
 * flightdelay-analysis.ipynb - I wanted to create a Jupyter notebook and did not have time to transfer the independent scripts into the notebook. 
 Next time :)
